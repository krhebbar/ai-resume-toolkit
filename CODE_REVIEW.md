# Codebase Review Summary

## Key Observations

- **Solid Foundation:** The project is a well-structured monorepo using npm workspaces, with a clear separation of concerns between the `text-extractor`, `json-parser`, and `scorer` packages.
- **Robust Extraction:** The `text-extractor` package employs a smart, multi-library fallback strategy to handle various PDF and DOCX formats effectively.
- **Schema-Driven Parsing:** The `json-parser`'s use of `zod` for schema definition and validation is a best practice that ensures reliable and structured data from LLM outputs.
- **Sophisticated Scoring:** The `scorer` package implements a powerful and configurable scoring system with weighted categories and advanced algorithms.
- **Excellent Developer Guidance:** The `AGENTS.md` file provides clear and comprehensive guidelines for project setup, development, and contribution.

## Key Improvement Areas

- **Critical Lack of Testing:** The most significant issue is the complete absence of an automated test suite. This introduces high risk for regressions and makes maintenance difficult and unsafe.
- **Architectural Rigidity:** The `json-parser` is tightly coupled to its LLM providers, making it difficult to extend or test in isolation.
- **Generic Error Handling:** The `text-extractor` uses overly broad exception handling, which obscures the root cause of parsing failures and complicates debugging.
- **API and Algorithm Clarity:** The `scorer` API could be more intuitive, and the mathematical reasoning behind its algorithms is not documented, making it hard to understand and modify.

## Actionable Recommendations

To address the issues above, I recommend the following actions:

1.  **Introduce a Comprehensive Test Suite (Highest Priority):**
    - **Action:** Implement `pytest` for the `text-extractor` package, with tests for successful parsing, handling of corrupted files, and OCR fallback logic.
    - **Action:** Implement `vitest` for the `json-parser` package, mocking the LLM provider dependencies to test schema validation and prompt construction independently.
    - **Action:** Implement `vitest` for the `scorer` package, with unit tests to verify the accuracy of the scoring algorithms against known inputs.

2.  **Refactor `json-parser` for Modularity and Testability:**
    - **Action:** Define a generic `LLMProvider` interface that abstracts the `parse` method.
    - **Action:** Refactor the `ResumeParser` to accept an `LLMProvider` instance via dependency injection in its constructor. This decouples the parser from concrete implementations like OpenAI or Anthropic.

3.  **Improve Error Handling in `text-extractor`:**
    - **Action:** Replace generic `except Exception` blocks with specific exception types from each PDF/DOCX library.
    - **Action:** Raise exceptions with more descriptive messages that include context about which parsing strategy failed.

4.  **Enhance `scorer` API and Documentation:**
    - **Action:** Create a dedicated TypeScript `type` or `interface` (e.g., `ScorableData`) for the `score` method's input to simplify its signature and improve type safety.
    - **Action:** Add detailed comments to `algorithms.ts` explaining the rationale behind the chosen scoring functions (e.g., why logarithmic scaling is used and what `rFactor` represents).

5.  **Expand Package-Level Documentation:**
    - **Action:** Update the `README.md` in each package to include a detailed API reference, configuration options, and practical usage examples.
